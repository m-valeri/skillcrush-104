			<h4>Remember to Breathe</h4>
			<p>Coding will not always go according to plan.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<p>If you're frustrated, walk away from the computer and take a few deep breaths.</p>

			<p>Returning with a relaxed attitude and fresh eyes can give you a whole new perspective.</p>
